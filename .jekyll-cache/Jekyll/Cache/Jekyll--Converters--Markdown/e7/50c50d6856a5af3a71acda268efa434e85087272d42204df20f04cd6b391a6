<h3 id="enconding-nature">Enconding Nature</h3>
<p>Following Daniel Shiffman and the coding train i really like doing small visual coding experiments where I make cool visuals using nature inspired algorithms like the Reaction Diffusion algorithm. I am at the moment working on implementing it in THREE.js and WebGL such that simulations of this algorithm can be shown in the browser at a nice speed!</p>

<h3 id="gan-experimenting">GAN experimenting</h3>
<p>Following the Kaggle Project I am something of a painter myself and inerest in GAN literature like ProGAN/StyleGAN/MSG-GAN I am trying to train one myself and test out some vool interpolations. Generative models are very tricky to train, but very fun to play with!</p>
